							<h1>About</h1>

							<p> Hi, I am a recent graduate from the University of California - Berkeley (class of 2024), 
								majoring in Data Science + Cognitive Science and minoring in Computer Science. 
								My academic journey began with a desire to explore as I aimed to broaden my knowledge and gain diverse perspectives to pull from.
								Consequently, I choose to major in two interdiscplinary fields, along with exploring other subjects like business, computer science, and UI/UX design.
								This exploration led to a special interest in data and product development.

								<br />
								<br />
								During these past four years, I've learned and grown within the classroom and outside through internships and non-profit consulting. 
								Through these experiences, I saw first-hand how data and technology can be leveraged to create positive changes and empower communities, 
								providing me the "why" that motivates my work. Now, as I take my first step out of college, I'm eager to continue developing my
								skills and contribute to projects that'll allow me to meaningfully impact the world.

								<br />
								<br />
								Outside of academics, I've been deeply involved in the dance community at Berkeley. Juggling 12 hours of practice/week, 
								working with teams of around 30-40, and taking on leadership positions, I grew through both the failures and successes. 
								Two core qualities I honed from these experiences include (1) proactivity (2) attention to detail, 
								since taking initiative and thoroughness were instrumental in planning and managing logistics for successful semesters.
								In general, beginning my dance journey as an adult, I've learned to approach new skills with resilience, an open-mind, and 
								confidence that hard-work and patience will eventually lead to success. It is with this mindset that I've successfully approached
								my academics and internships, and which I'll continue to apply in my everyday life.
